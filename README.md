Users can display the notes by clicking on them, or delete them with the trash button.

> Note that currently, anyone can save and delete notes. Please be courteous to other users.

# Installation

`express` and `uuid` are required to run this app.

They can both be installed by running `npm i` in the terminal after downloading.

`heroku` is required to be hosted as a live page.

# Usage
